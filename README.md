# Blog API

---

This is a RESTful Blog API built using **FastAPI** that allows users to create, read, update and delete blog posts. The
API supports user authentication, ensuring that only authenticated users can manage their own blog posts.

## Features üåü

- **Create a Blog Post**: Authenticated users can create blog posts with a title and body.
- **Read Blog Posts**: Retrieve all blog posts or get individual posts by ID.
- **Update a Blog Post**: Users can update their own blog posts.
- **Delete a Blog Post**: Users can delete their own blog posts.
- **User Authentication**: JWT-based authentication to secure access.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

- **FastAPI**: For building the API.
- **SQLite/PostgreSQL**: Database to store user and blog data.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: For user authentication.
- **Pydantic**: For data validation.
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server to run the application.

## Getting Started üèÅ

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites üìã

- **Python 3.8+**: Make sure Python is installed on your machine.
- **FastAPI**: Install FastAPI and Uvicorn by running the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install fastapi uvicorn
  ```

### Project Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
   git clone
    cd blog-api
2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required Python packages using `pip`:
    ```bash
   pip install -rm requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Database Setup**:
    - By default, the API uses SQLite for simplicity, but you can modify it to use PostgreSQL or any other database.
    - If using SQLite, the database will be created automatically when you run the app.

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the project root to store sensitive data (like secret keys)
   and database configurations:
    ```bash
   SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret_key
   DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./blog.db
   ```

### Running the Application ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

To start the FastAPI server, run the following command:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## Authentication Flow üîë

1. Register a new user by sending a `POST` request to `/register`.
2. Login to get a JWT token from `/login`.
3. Include the JWT token in the `Authorization` header as follows for all authenticated requests:

  ```makefile
  Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
  ```
